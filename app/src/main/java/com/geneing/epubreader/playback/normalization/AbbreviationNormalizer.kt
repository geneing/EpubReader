/**
 * Expands common English abbreviations to the words a reader would say.
 *
 * The list is deliberately conservative ("do no harm"): every entry is a
 * near-unambiguous title, Latin abbreviation, month, day or organisation that
 * a TTS engine would otherwise mangle. Ambiguous short forms (`no.`, `in.`,
 * `ft.`, `vol.`) are intentionally left out unless a safe context rule can be
 * added later.
 *
 * Sources distilled for the initial list: the Ossian text normalisation
 * abbreviation map (CSTR Edinburgh), MaryTTS `preprocess/abbrev.dat`, the
 * Oxford-derived MUSE abbreviation dictionary, the Google Kestrel/
 * WeTextProcessing whitespace whitelist, and Tortoise-TTS `_abbreviations`.
 * See `docs/TEXT_NORMALIZATION.md`.
