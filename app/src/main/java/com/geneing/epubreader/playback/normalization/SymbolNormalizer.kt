/**
 * Spells symbols and number-adjacent signs: `&`, `+`, `=`, `©`, a leading
 * phone `+`, and repeated abbreviation periods.
 *
 * `%`, `°` and `x`/`×` are handled where their meaning depends on a preceding
 * number ([PercentageNormalizer], [UnitAndSymbolNormalizer]). A period left
 * between single letters (`e.g` -> `eg`, `a.m` -> `am`) is only collapsed when
 * every letter around it is lower case, so the sentence-ending period of
 * "He saw Dr. X." stays put.
