/**
 * Converts bare Arabic numerals to spoken words.
 *
 * Handles comma-grouped thousands (`1,234,567`), decimal points (`3.14`) and
 * four-digit years (`1999`, `2005`). Negative values keep their sign and are
 * spoken as "minus ...." A hyphen that follows a digit is never treated as a
 * sign, so `3-5` reaches [RangeNormalizer] instead. Numbers attached to
 * letters on both sides (`3D`) are left alone. Structured numeric forms
 * (currency, percentages, ordinals, dates, phones, units, ranges, versions)
 * are consumed by earlier rules in the pipeline; this is the catch-all for
 * what remains.
