/**
 * Handles initialisms and acronyms, optionally with a user lexicon.
 *
 * A known acronym is replaced by its pronunciation ("NATO" -> "Nato"); an
 * unlisted all-caps word is spelled letter by letter when it looks like an
 * initialism ("WHO" -> "W H O"). A word that contains a vowel is assumed to be
 * pronounceable and left to the engine, and mixed-case words are untouched.
 *
 * [lexicon] holds user pronunciation substitutions, applied afterwards so the
 * user always wins. It is a plain map of written form to spoken form. There is
 * no UI for it yet; wiring a Settings editor to this parameter is the intended
 * extension point (see `docs/TEXT_NORMALIZATION.md`).
